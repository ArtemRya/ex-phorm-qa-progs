| Original Smooth Operator by Brad Smith (AIM - bradps) - http://www.mindsmith.net/
|    - Original template included with AdiumX
|
|
|       -Great original template, Brad!-
|
|       NOTE: WHEN UPDATING, replace all files with ones included in archive
|
|
\--------------------------------------------------------------
 |
 |  How do I install this? (assuming you have IEView set up properly)
 |    1) Extract the files using 7zip, Winrar, or XP's built in ZIP support
 |       (anything that can extract .ZIPs properly will do) to any folder
 |        > It is -recommended- to extract in the Miranda folder.
 |    2) Go to the IEView options and go to the Templates tab.
 |    3) Browse (...) for the folder SmoothOperator\ that you should have remembered
 |       and double click the smoothoperator.ivt file (in SmoothOperator\ folder).
 |    4) Hit Apply and start chatting!
 |
 |  Variations? Only 2 this time:
 |    - smoothoperator.ivt - The original
 |    - smoothoperator_topbar.ivt - It has a topbar, like in the BigIcons port
 |                		    (no toggling) and does not show avatars as
 | 				    avatars are shown in the bar. The bar is 
 | 				    translucent.
 |
 |  Stuff you'll want to know:
 |    -  What colour schemes of Smooth Operator are available to me?
 |        > Currently there are only 2 colour schemes. The only differences
 |          will be the background style (default is blue fade).
 |        > All variations will be under the SmoothOperator\images\ folder
 |          and have filenames that begin with "background_".
 |            = background.png - Default blue fade.
 |            = backgroundwhite.png - A grey/white fade.
 |        > To change schemes (backgrounds):
 |            1) Open smoothoperator.ivt in Notepad
 |            2) Choose a background from the SmoothOperator\images\ folder
 |            3) Put the name of the background (ex. backgroundwhite.png) into
 |               the line that looks like this:
 |                   body { font-family:Lucida Grande; background: white url(images/background.png) center top repeat-x fixed; }
 |            4) Replace background.png with the name of the background
 |               that you found (ex. replace background.png WITH backgroundwhite.png).
 |
 |    -  Why isn't my avatar showing up?
 |        > You need to save your avatar under the \SmoothOperator\ folder
 |          that is extracted from the .ZIP archive as myavatar.jpg. There
 |          is already a file named myavatar.jpg; it is the default avatar
 |          to be in place of your actual avatar.
 |
 |    -  Why isn't my buddy's avatar showing up?
 |        > You need the latest version of IEView (1.0.1.7) and
 |          TabSRMM (http://tabsrmm.sf.net)
 |
 |    -  So, I hear of PNG Transparency. What's so good about it?
 |        > Choose any background you wish and plant it into the code
 |          and you'll have a beautifully blended background with the 
 |          conversation =)
 |        > Changing of backgrounds is explained above.
 |
 |    -  Does message grouping work?
 |        > Yup! Just enable it in Miranda IM Options -> IEView plugin -> Templates tab
 |    
 |    -  Thanks to:
 |        > cpm for the Javascript code provided when doing Satin (used in
 |          Smooth Operator also)
 |        > karma.police for Javascript code to trim PM and AM when using 
 |          12 hour time.
