 |  How do I install this? (assuming you have IEView set up properly)
 |    1) Extract the files using 7zip, Winrar, or XP's built in ZIP support
 |       (anything that can extract .ZIPs properly will do) to any folder
 |        > It is -recommended- to extract in the Miranda folder.
 |    2) Go to the IEView options and go to the Message Log tab.
 |    3) Check the Templates checkbox
 |    3) Browse (...) for the folder Zinc\ that you should have remembered
 |       and double click the Zinc.ivt file (in Zinc\ folder).
 |    4) Hit Apply and start chatting!

 |  Stuff you'll want to know:
 |    -  Includes a variation which uses large timestamps and one which
 |	 uses small timestamps.
 |
 |    -  So, I hear of PNG Transparency. What's so good about it?
 |        > Choose any background you wish and plant it into the code
 |          and you'll have a beautifully blended background with the 
 |          conversation =)
 |        > You can change backgrounds by editing the Zinc.ivt file.
 |	      - Edit background.png (6th line) to whatever background
 |              filename your own is (place image file into Zinc\images\
 |              folder)
 |
 |    -  Does message grouping work?
 |        > Yup! Just enable it in Miranda IM Options -> IEView plugin -> Message Log tab
 |    
 |    -  Thanks to:
 |	  > Calintz for a beautiful mock
 |        > cpm for the Javascript code provided when doing Satin (used in
 |          Zinc also)
